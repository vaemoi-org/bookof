# Development Workflows

When it came to development, no matter how close we were physically because every team member has his or her own day job and life outside of the project, we decided to operate like a distributed team. This meant _**everything from standups and designing to testing and releasing had to be accessible by any team member from any machine.**_ From this single requirement came our collection of tools mentioned in [Chapter 1 ](/chapter1.md)and the following workflow suggestions.



### Ruby

#### Gem

#### Rails

### Javascript \(with npm\)

### Python \(with pypi\)

### Static Site

#### HTML

#### CSS
